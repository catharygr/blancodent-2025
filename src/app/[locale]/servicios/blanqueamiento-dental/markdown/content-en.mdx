    "This dental treatment helps to address discolouration of the teeth. The mouth is one of the parts of the body that most reflects personality and says the most about a person. When we speak or laugh, it is always exposed to the judgement of others because it is one of the areas of the face we focus on the most. Having white teeth is more than just a beautiful smile. Our mouth reflects our personality and can give or take away confidence, depending on how we appear to others. Having a healthy smile and white teeth is something we all desire.",

## We are specialists in Teeth Whitening in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.

Teeth whitening is based on the use of products that work through oxidation, whitening the teeth. It is a simple and painless procedure that provides immediate results. Most importantly, it does not damage the teeth.

Nowadays, the only safe treatment we can trust is the one carried out under the supervision of dental aesthetics professionals. Products that patients can purchase themselves, such as mouthwashes, toothpastes, or varnishes, are not whiteners. They are highly abrasive and harmful to the enamel.

If you want teeth whitening in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, you can visit us. Your white teeth will smile for you.

## Recommendation.

We recommend that you visit your dentist in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. Not everyone has the same tooth colour. Some teeth are more yellow, others are greyer, but almost all of them can be whitened.

There are also several types of teeth whitening. At home, with customised trays; in the clinic, with the application of the product and activation with an LED lamp, laser, or chemical activation; and the mixed treatment, combining the two previous methods. This last method is faster and more effective.

## Dental Cleaning.

In general, it is necessary to have a complete professional dental cleaning (ultrasound plus professional brushing) before undergoing teeth whitening.

As you can see, this dental treatment is easy and affordable. Having white teeth and a beautiful smile is now within reach of anyone who desires it.
